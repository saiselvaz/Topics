Use of this keyword(Lexical Scope)

Scope:means area, space, or region.

Global scope: means global space or a public space.

Local scope: means a local region or a restricted region.


Template Literals:
Template literals are literals delimited with backtick (`) characters, allowing for multi-line strings, string interpolation with embedded expressions, and special constructs called tagged templates.


SPREAD AND REST PARAMETERS

SPREAD,
The JavaScript spread operator (...) allows us to quickly copy all or part of an existing array or object into another array or object.


REST: 
The rest parameter syntax allows a function to accept an indefinite number of arguments as an array, providing a way to represent variadic functions in JavaScript.


DESTRUCTURING:
Destructuring is a convenient way of creating new variables by extracting some values from data stored in objects or arrays.

Hoisting: 
its just a behaviour where the variable declarations or the function declarations moved to the top of the file.



 spread operator: 
it takes out the values from the array and spreads it wherever we need as raw values



rest operator:
// the rest argument will receive any number of variable arguments passed via the function call and store it as an array


function is hoisted
// // it works, because the function definition has been moved to the top of the file -> hoisting


// scoping: it tells the visibility of a reference/variable
// global scope, function scope, block scope, local scope


FUNCTIONS
// functions are a block of statements that gets executed when we call it.


1.named function.   2.nameless function or anonymous function
3.arrow function
4.IIFE function: Immediately Invoked Function Expression
// its an anonymous function without any reference
// since it does not have any reference, we cannot call it later
// so, we should call it immediately after the function block.



lexical scoping: static scoping
// it determines the scope of a variable or identifier based on where it is declared rather than where it is executed during runtime.



Understanding JSX:

JSX allows us to write HTML elements in JavaScript and place them in the DOM without any createElement() and/or appendChild() methods


Understanding the Props:
the data can be passed from one component to another component using these props, similar to how the arguments are passed in a function.



Passing data through Props:

Props data is sent by the parent component and cannot be changed by the child component as they are read-only.
