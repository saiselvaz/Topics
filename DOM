WHAT IS DOM?
The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects; that way, programming languages can interact with the page.


createElement() — create a new element

setAttribute() — set any needed
 attributes, such as ID's or classes

createTextNode() — create any needed content
1
appendChild() — attach the new text node to the element


QUERY SELECTOR VS QUERY SELECTORALL

querySelector is used to select a single element from the DOM tree, while document. querySelectorAll is used to select multiple elements from the DOM tree.

INNERTEXT VS INNERHTML

innerText returns all text contained by an element and all its child elements. innerHtml returns all text, including html tags, that is contained by an element.


append vs appendChild
Element.append() allows you to also append string objects, whereas Node.appendChild() only accepts Node objects.

Window - Common Util function 
There are no official standards for the Browser Object Model (BOM).

window.innerHeight - the inner height of the browser window (in pixels)

window.innerWidth - the inner width of the browser window (in pixels)

OTHER METHODS
window.open() - open a new window

window.close() - close the current window

window.moveTo() - move the current window

window.resizeTo() - resize the current window

setTimeout Vs setInterval

setTimeout(function, milliseconds)
Executes a function, after waiting a specified number of milliseconds.

setInterval(function, milliseconds)
Same as setTimeout(), but repeats the execution of the function continuously.


PROMPT, ALERT AND CONFIRM
alert(message): Display a popup box with the specified message with the OK button.

confirm(message): Display a popup box with the specified message with OK and Cancel buttons.

prompt(message, defaultValue): Display a popup box to take the user's input with the OK and Cancel buttons

window.alert(), window.confirm(), window.prompt().


WORKING WITH EVENTS

addEventListener();

The addEventListener() method attaches an event handler to the specified element.

document.getElementById("myBtn").addEventListener("click", displayDate);


onClick Event:
The onclick event occurs when the user clicks on an HTML element.

dbClick Event:
The dblclick event fires when a pointing device button (such as a mouse's primary button) is double-clicked;

onLoad Event:
The onload event occurs when an object has been loaded.

onload is most often used within the <body> element to execute a script once a web page has completely loaded all content (including images, script files, CSS files, etc.).

onResize Event:
The onresize event occurs when the browser window has been resized.
